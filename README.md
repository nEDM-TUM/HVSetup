# HVSetup

This repository is / will be initialized with the accumulated scripts and code from my thesis and work on the HVSetup (optical E-field measurements). This includes
(1) Python scripts to test and run the various components of the setup from the Raspberry Pi, including data acquisition via oscilloscope
(2) Python scripts to process and display the data (using ROOT)
(3) CINT C programs to manipulate certain ROOT files
(4) Segmented Discrete Fourier Transform
